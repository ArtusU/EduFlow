EduFlow is a Learning Management System (LMS) that delivers a dynamic and immersive learning experience. It is a simplified version of popular online learning platforms such as Udemy, Skillshare, and Learnable, designed to cater to the diverse educational needs of our users.

Through EduFlow, users can register and access a wide range of courses, track their progress, take quizzes, and connect with other course participants. Our platform is built with state-of-the-art technology, powered by the Django Rest Framework at the back end and Vue.js at the front end. This ensures a seamless user experience that is both efficient and intuitive.

We are committed to providing an innovative and engaging online learning environment that helps users achieve their educational goals. With EduFlow, we strive to make learning a smooth and enjoyable journey that inspires personal growth and development.
